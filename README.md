# HTML5 Canvas Graphics and Animations

This repo was created to store my practice work of [HTML5 Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API). The work was created only for practice and fun.

## Project Description
### Round Rectangle
- Wrote a function that draws a round cornered rectangle to get myself familiar with the `CanvasRenderingContext2D.arcTo()` method.
